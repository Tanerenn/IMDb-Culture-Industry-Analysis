> **"The culture industry has transformed art into a commercial commodity and converted it into a standardized factory product."** — Theodor Adorno

## 📌 Project Purpose

This project analyzes the transformation of cinema over the years through a data science perspective, based on Theodor Adorno's theory of the **"Culture Industry."** Using the **IMDb Top 250** dataset, we sought answers to the following fundamental questions:

* Are movies becoming standardized in terms of duration and content?
* Are artistic genres (Drama) being replaced by consumption-oriented genres (Action)?
* Is the criterion for success quality (Rating) or popularity (Box Office)?

---

## 📊 Findings & Visualizations

### 1. Standardization of Runtime
Upon examining the data, we observe that movie runtimes have settled into a specific commercial pattern (a "standard package"). The industry tends to prefer durations that are "easiest to consume" for the audience to avoid financial risk.

### 2. The Shift in Genres: From Art to Entertainment
The most striking finding of the project is the divergence between genres.
* **Pre-2000:** Drama and artistic narrative were dominant.
* **Post-2000:** There has been an explosion in Action and Adventure genres.

This confirms that cinema has begun to appeal more to the "entertained consumer" rather than the "thinking individual."

### 3. Box Office vs. Rating (Art vs. Commodity)
According to the correlation analysis, the highest-grossing films are not always those with the highest artistic ratings. In the culture industry, "success" is measured by marketing budgets and box office figures rather than artistic depth.
